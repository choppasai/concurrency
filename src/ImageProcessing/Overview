Many image processing applications like Lightroom & Photoshop use multiple threads to process an image quickly.
This project is to build a simplified image repainting task using multiple threads,
the repainting task here simply doubles the value of every pixel stored in the form of a 2D array.
Take Input a NXN matrix and repaint it by using 4 threads, one for each quadrant.
